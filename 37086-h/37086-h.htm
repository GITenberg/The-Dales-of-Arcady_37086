PROLOGUE
</H3>

<P CLASS="prologue">
The youngest Goddess sat in a corner of the Universe and sulked.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
For æons, she had watched the older Goddesses play each in turn with
the Earth-Ball, and every time the Ball passed her way, someone said,
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
"She is too young, and, if she played with the Ball, might injure it."
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
Another added,
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
"Even our honourable Sister E&mdash;&mdash; created baleful Etna in her ardent
desire to give a beauteous mountain to flowering Sicily, and C&mdash;&mdash;,
when she designed the azure Mediterranean, raised her little finger all
too hurriedly, causing the whirlpool so dreaded by Grecian sailors."
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
But the youngest Goddess had waited long and was becoming mutinous.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
Her great grey eyes, like silent moorland tarns fringed with shadowy
larches, were fixed on the handiwork of the Goddess who at that moment
held the Ball.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
She noticed the blue line thoughtfully traced across a vast tract of
land, the line men call the River Amazon, and she watched the Designer
proudly hold the Ball aloft to show her handiwork to her sisters.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
"Surely it is the finest river we have yet traced!"
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
"Nay! let me see it."
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
"Can it be greater than that which Mortals call the Ganges?"
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
Then, as the Designer of the Amazon threw the Ball above the head of
the youngest Goddess toward the lap of a weary, responsible-looking
sister, the youngest Goddess leapt above the little silvern stars, and
caught it in her lithe white arms.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
A look of consternation went round the Universe.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
"She is too young to play!"
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
But the youngest Goddess claspt the Ball to her breast.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
"Let me play, just once," she pleaded.  "I will make no earthquakes, no
volcanoes, no geysers, nothing that could spoil the beauty of the Ball."
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
Then an old Goddess&mdash;so old that she could remember God calling order
out of chaos, hobbled towards her.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
"Child! thou hast seized the Ball, and play with it thou wilt, but
disturb not the handiwork of thine elder sisters.  Thou canst pattern
only where they have not worked."
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
So the youngest Goddess held the Ball up to the glance of God to get a
great light upon it, and by chance found one small space covered with
heather and bilberry, a wild sad waste.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
"Here, I may play!  Oh! my sisters, I would make something rarer and
more beautiful of my little wild heath than any of you have dreamed of
for other parts of the Ball."
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
Lovingly she laid her outstretched hand upon the bosom of the moorland,
and when she lifted it the uplands bore the soft imprint, and a little
river flowed where each finger had rested.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
Thus were created
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent" STYLE="margin-left: 10%; font-style: italic">
Airedale,<BR>
Wharfedale,<BR>
Nidderdale,<BR>
Wensleydale, and<BR>
Swaledale.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent" STYLE="font-style: italic">
And because the fingers of the youngest Goddess quivered with pleasure
they are merry little dancing rivers, and even play underground as they
ripple to the Ouse.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
In this wise she fulfilled her desire to make something rarer and more
beautiful of her moorland waste than her sisters had ever dreamed of
for any other part of the Ball.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
But, being very young, she boasted of her wondrous achievement, and, as
a punishment, the other Goddesses prevented her from ever playing with
the Ball again.
</P>

<P CLASS="prologue">
That is the reason there is only one Daleshire.

<P CLASS="poem">
When sad home-longings, like little waifs,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to my heart, in a stranger-land,<BR>
No thought of a house sweeps over me,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No pleasant thorp does my heart demand;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the great blue open wold it cries,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the road that over the moorland lies.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For heather lands where the plovers wing,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where frail mists gather about the hills<BR>
Like mystic shapes that eerily cling,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the air is hushed for the snipe-loved rills:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these my tired heart greets as "Home,"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When and wherever I'm forced to roam.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In the dales the pollarded willows flower:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the wings of a mating thrush;<BR>
The river has gained its spated hour,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mad, magnificent, tumbling rush;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to break their hearts or sing,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own sweet dales are expecting spring.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
No flower-girt cottage means home to me,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No stately, splendid ancestral pile,<BR>
No cosy house builded pleasantly<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my wandering-weary heart beguile,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the homesick heart of me longs to hail<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My county of lovering moor and dale!<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Over the rough-hewn limestone wall,<BR>
I watched the serpenting river crawl<BR>
Adown the dale, thro' dimpled fields,<BR>
Daisy-brimmed, where Almscliffe shields<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rocky crest<BR>
The lambs that play on the old Earth's breast.<BR>

Gently I felt God's hand in mine,<BR>

May over this country roam at will.</I>"<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
On the wings of the wind I heard Him sigh:<BR>
"Unheedingly many&mdash;so many&mdash;pass by,<BR>
Tho' the world is full of My fairest thought,<BR>
Of all that My servant Time hath wrought,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so rare<BR>
To hear that My work is surpassing fair."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"<I>O!  Grant my prayer, and let me stay<BR>
In this land where Thy little rivers stray,<BR>
For I love them, God, with a love so true,<BR>
Remembering they are a part of You.<BR>

THE SONG OF NIDDERDALE<BR>

As I came past the Brimham Rocks<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the thrushes calling,<BR>
And saw the pleasant, winding Nidd<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In peaty ripples falling.<BR>
Its banks were gay with witching flowers,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the folk did hail<BR>
Me back again so cheerily<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bonnie Nidderdale.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The blackbirds in the birchen holts<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The live-long day were singing,<BR>
Where countless azure hyacinths<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their perfumed bells were ringing.<BR>
And Guisecliff stands in loneliness<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the moor and vale,<BR>
Protecting with its rocky scaur<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My bonnie Nidderdale.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And as I passed thro' Pateley Brigg,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman carolled blithely,<BR>
And up and down the cobbled streets<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bairnies skipped so lithely.<BR>
The sky was blue, and silken clouds,<BR>

Swept o'er the waking larchen woods<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of bonnie Nidderdale.<BR>

Where grey-stone dykes, and greyer garths<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look down on Ramsgill village,<BR>
The thieving, gawmless, gay tomtits<BR>

Grey Middlesmoor is perched upon<BR>

THE MOORS IN SUMMER<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Up to the moorlands a lingtit has flown&mdash;<BR>
(Another meadow has yet to be mown<BR>
Before the sun goes under the hill).<BR>
I will hie me down, for a drink, to the rill:<BR>
A wheatear mimics the whinchat's call,<BR>
And a cuckoo cries from the Woods of Wath<BR>
As a heron soars over the verdant strath,<BR>
And an ousel pipes from the grey stone wall.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drink in a dream&mdash;<BR>
The water flows from a Fairy Stream.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the smell of the ling my heart is a-yearn,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sharp, sweet tang of a moorland burn.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The lingtit waited anent a gate<BR>
Where foxgloves held their midsummer fête,<BR>
Then on she sped o'er the feathery green<BR>
Of the bracken fronds, flying beneath and between,<BR>
Till she reached a dyke where the bents and moors<BR>
Stretched out to the sky in a rolling sea<BR>
Of wave upon wavelet of purpling glee,<BR>
O'er a land where the wistful lapwing lures.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sought to rest<BR>
On the moorland's soft, sweet, heathery breast,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When out of the bilberries, spick and clean,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small man stepped, in a coat of green.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He bowed to the earth, with an old-world grace,<BR>
Then lifted his eyes to my sun-tanned face:<BR>
"<I>So you are the Mortal who drank from our rill,<BR>
A cordial welcome to Bilberry Hill!</I>"<BR>
He peered again, and he watched mine eyes,<BR>
Then turning, he whistled the lapwing's note.<BR>
For a moment the melody seemed to float<BR>
O'er the heather; and then with increased surprise<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a troop<BR>
Of little green men around me group.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all bowed low, "I thought you had fled<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yorkshire Uplands, green men!" I said.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
They smiled at each other.  Their leader broke<BR>
The hush of the heather, and thus he spoke:<BR>
"<I>Ling-men! her eyes are the eyes of the fells,<BR>
Grey as the clouds and blue as the bells<BR>
Of the harebell.  See! how they flash and play<BR>
As the rivulet does 'neath the rowan and birk;<BR>
'Tis a glance in which there's loving a-lurk;<BR>
A glance that only is born on the brae.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ling-men!  I am sure<BR>
A changeling is she, and belongs to the moor.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her way she lost as a weeny bairn.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men found her, and town-ways they made her learn.<BR>
Capture her heart so she cannot roam<BR>
Far away from her grouse-loved home,<BR>
Weave from the cottony grasses a chain<BR>
That will pull at her heart with a wild, dear pain;<BR>
Fashion a gyve from the wings of the lark,<BR>
Manacles make from the bumble-bees' croon,<BR>
To keep her a captive from June to June,<BR>
To render her ours in the light, in the dark!</I>"<BR>

FIRST DAY<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearken!  The South Wind's voice.<BR>
My lover returns, and the valleys rejoice.<BR>
The bees fly upward to watch his flight,<BR>
The butterflies quiver with glad delight,<BR>
As he teasingly touches their jewelled wings.<BR>
O! at his bidding the whitethroat swings<BR>
In thrillant blue.  A thrush's call<BR>
Blends with a blackbird's madrigal.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I steadily gazed at my silent pen,<BR>
Attempting to keep from my straying ken<BR>
An Eden of woods, of bosoming hills,<BR>
Of verdant hedges, of wandering rills.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can one work<BR>
When a Lover amid the flowers will lurk?<BR>
He tip-toes in thro' the window-door,<BR>
And whisks my papers on to the floor;<BR>
With flower-steeped hands he caresses my hair,<BR>
And whispers alluringly,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<I>Fair, most Fair,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slip your slender hand in mine, my Sweeting,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear! the skylarks cleave the blue with greeting,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the blackcap on the thorn at even<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trill truths that echo to the highest heaven,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave your world of carking care, time-haunted,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a country ever spring-enchaunted.</I>"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He leads me on to the dewy grass,<BR>
Where maiden primroses troop and pass;<BR>
With a gleesome kiss in his arms he swings<BR>
Me up 'twixt his eagle-wide rainbow wings:<BR>
Over a willowy coppice he goes<BR>
Flicking the hedges of milk-white sloes,<BR>
Over the blazon of heralding gorse,<BR>
Deftly he steers his ethereal course<BR>
Over anemone hillocks, o'er leas,<BR>
Hyacinth-dimpled, o'er buttercupped leas,<BR>
Over the ings where forget-me-not eyes<BR>
Borrow the blue of azureal skies;<BR>
Over the meadow-flats, higher and higher,<BR>
Sweeping the strings of the cloud-strung lyre.<BR>
The lilt of the planets is in mine ear,<BR>
Crystal dropping on crystal clear:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Wind, my Lover,<BR>
My mortal eyes must you surely cover:<BR>
Such beauty will make me beauty-blind,<BR>
Protect mine eyes, O my Lover Wind."<BR>
Then, as I lost my indrawn breath,<BR>
He swirled me down to the earth beneath,<BR>
Down thro' the depths of a forest of pine,<BR>
On to a carpet of celandine.<BR>
The goldcrests twittered, the squirrels chased,<BR>
While the lofty pines, brown arms enlaced,<BR>
Lisped a dryad-taught melody, sung by the sea.<BR>
Known in the valleys of Arcady.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For a little space did my Lover sleep,<BR>
While the gold-mailed sun with me did keep<BR>
A radiant watch; but when Eventide<BR>
In saffron-rose wrapped the woodland side,<BR>
He started up, and he kissed my neck,<BR>
Then, bidding me rise at his instant beck,<BR>
We passed where the sovran oak-trees nod,<BR>
Where never a human foot has trod,<BR>
Where birches sway in slenderest grace,<BR>
That never have seen a mortal's face;<BR>
Where rivulets hasten in sweet surprise,<BR>
A wonder beneath my wond'ring eyes;<BR>
A lakelet trembled beneath my glance,<BR>
The lily-white elfins ceased their dance;<BR>
A cherry-tree flung confetti down,<BR>
And framed for my head a loving crown.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft-toned bells<BR>
Called to each other across the fells.<BR>
While music played on a reeded flute<BR>
Stilled the air, and the birds were mute.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"O leaf-loving Zephyr, whence cometh the mirth<BR>
Of this melody?  Owns my mothering Earth<BR>
A piper who pipes so alluringly<BR>
Of beauty that is, of beauty to be?<BR>
Onward! o'er thousands of blushet-shy daisies,<BR>
To find this piper of beautiful phrases."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
'Mong flocks of goats, and of leaping lambs,<BR>
The piper sat.  Two fierce-horned rams<BR>
Made a fleecy cushion whereon he sat,<BR>
And a sleeping ewe made a creamy mat<BR>
For his hoofed feet.  His music ceased.<BR>
Green were his eyes, and they seemed well pleased<BR>
As they lit on our forms:<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<I>O!  Pan, great Pan!<BR>

And she would learn of the singing seasons'<BR>
Wonderful featness; of all the reasons.<BR>
The hill and the wood and the rippling rill<BR>
The air with different melodies fill;<BR>
Where bonnibel April latest was sent,<BR>
When May filled the world with her wonderment!<BR>
Who teaches the cuckoo his twin-bell call?<BR>
The opening notes of a festival<BR>
To jubilate the reign of the summer<BR>
Beauteous, queenliest, rosy-robed comer.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Pan!  I bring<BR>
A mortal whose soul is afire to sing.</I>"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Pan smiled&mdash;a smile like a twisted oak&mdash;<BR>
Then beckoned to me, while the forest spoke,<BR>
"Evoë, great Pan," sang the lark on high,<BR>
"Evoë, great Pan," from the uttermost sky;<BR>
I drew near and stood beside his knee:<BR>
He handed his reeded flute to me,<BR>
And kept his eyes, of a forest green,<BR>
On my trembling hands.  O! well, I ween,<BR>
He knew that my amateur hands were weak,<BR>
For the spirit of me was meek, so meek,<BR>
And his green eyes glimmered with rising glee.<BR>
My masterful Lover whispered to me,<BR>
"<I>Put your lips to the flute with mine,<BR>
Heedless of self-hood, in song be divine.</I>"<BR>
And placing near mine his golden-sweet mouth,<BR>
A rondeau he sang of the forest's youth.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Pan spoke at last: "Child! wander and learn<BR>
The lilt of the bird and the song of the burn:<BR>
And when thou hast learned from the burn and the bird<BR>
Thou'lt find me again" (the forest heart stirred).<BR>
"Hail! child from the plaintful Kingdom of Man."<BR>
The mountain-tops shouted, "Evoë, great Pan!"<BR>
The rivers sang deeply, "Evoë, great Pan!"<BR>
And whisperingly I, "Evoë, great Pan!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="t3">
SECOND DAY<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The rose-trees show but a tuft of green<BR>
Where a stern, cold pruning-knife has been,<BR>
But they promise a summer of fragrant wealth:<BR>
How the small buds come to the light by stealth<BR>
Like pixies shy; yet a pruning knife<BR>
Leads every browny-bare branch to life.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly I passed thro' the rustic gate,<BR>
Where wine-red roses will hold June fête;<BR>
The wind stole out from the blossoming row<BR>
Of the cherry-trees, and he whispered low:<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"<I>Are you content to be bound by a wall,<BR>
E'en tho' it boundeth things beautiful?<BR>
Tho' cherry and apple bloom over it fall,<BR>
Always it is, and it hath been, a wall.<BR>
'Tis true that thro' it there is a wicket,<BR>
But what can it know of the wild grown thicket<BR>
That grows where its pathway may never wander:<BR>
Out of this garden&mdash;the blue land yonder?</I>"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And a cuckoo called; and the echo ran,<BR>
"Evoë, Evoë, Evoë, great Pan!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then my Lover lifted me up in his arms,<BR>
And swiftly arose.  How the grey-roofed farms<BR>
Receded into the cup-like earth!<BR>
And I chanted a canzone of Springtime and Birth,<BR>
Which called o'er the sea to the firstling swallow,<BR>
Who flew beside us o'er height and hollow,<BR>
Till others came from their home of the Sun,<BR>
And the farm-folk cried, "Dear Summer's begun."<BR>
Hundreds and thousands followed our flight&mdash;<BR>
ALL ENGLAND WILL HAVE A SWALLOW TO-NIGHT.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
By the old elm's portal of Arcady<BR>
My Lover alighted and whispered to me,<BR>
"O lily of laughter!  O sister of flowers!<BR>
Wander alone in Arcadian bowers,<BR>
And I will return when the sun goes down,<BR>
And wing you home to your grey, grey town.<BR>
I kiss your little white hands and feet:<BR>
Farewell!"  And he rose, on wings so fleet<BR>
Over the nests in the cradling larch,<BR>
Over the bow of the rainbow's arch.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Where conifers grow in fine profusion,<BR>
And birches quiver in sweet confusion,<BR>
Where hawthorn waits with a danseuse grace<BR>
To burst on the scene with her milk-white face,<BR>
And pirouette near some stately spruce,<BR>
Scattering around him pearly dews,<BR>
Where rabbits scamper thro' grasses lush,<BR>
And a pheasant's screech breaks the noon-day hush,<BR>
I journeyed on, till the sun began<BR>
His westering course.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evoë, great Pan!<BR>
Never a note of your pipings to-day<BR>
Has guided my steps thro' the sylvan way.<BR>
O! where must I seek in this Paradise?"<BR>
"Evoë, Evoë," a linnet sighs,<BR>
"Seek where the sisterly marshes are,<BR>
Where the marigold twinkles, a golden star,<BR>
Where willow and alder hide the river,<BR>
Where timid reed-warblers tremble and shiver."<BR>
The sky showed pink thro' the branches grey,<BR>
And then I heard, as if far away,<BR>
A tremulous song, a music of fears<BR>
That was strung together by trills of tears,<BR>
A quivering star glowed, curtained by leaves,<BR>
And the hullets called from some distant eaves.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I found Pan crouched by the river's edge,<BR>
His hoofed feet hid by the rushy sedge,<BR>
And I listened his plaint.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O great god Pan,<BR>
You sing with the broken heart of a man!<BR>
Your song is of Syrinx, who, æons ago,<BR>
Escaped from your loving.  Alas! that you know<BR>
The music of love, and the music of lack,<BR>
And you mourn for the hours that cannot come back,&mdash;<BR>
But I would learn of merrier things:<BR>
The melody murmurs of fluttering wings,<BR>
The secrets that fill the nightingaled glades,<BR>
The music that stirs in the leaf-colonnades."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He piped for a minute, then, turning to me,<BR>
With a wry, queer smile, said: "In Arcady<BR>
No song goes forth to the listening earth<BR>
That comes not thro' travail and tears to birth:<BR>
The river weeps as it leaves the fell,<BR>
And the note cries out as it mourns the bell;<BR>
The bird that praises the young, fair dawn,<BR>
Sings of his loss on the twilit lawn,<BR>
And those that hymn of the coming spring<BR>
Lament for her too, when she taketh wing.<BR>
The song of songs is of Death and of Love&mdash;<BR>
I sing of Syrinx, my own ... lost ... love."<BR>
He piped again, and the blue mists frail<BR>
Swayed in the dusk to the tender wail,<BR>
And I dreamed&mdash;till I felt on my damp, moist hair,<BR>
My Love's cool hand, and his whisper, "<I>Fair</I>,"<BR>
Then I felt his arms, and I knew the skies,<BR>
Whilst over the mountains I saw Dawn arise,<BR>
And another sweet day its course began,<BR>
While the hidden stars sang, "Evoë, great Pan!"<BR>
And the lark in the blue, "Evoë, great Pan!"<BR>
And wistfully I, "Evoë, great Pan!"<BR>

To live thro' cloud-spun days, thro' endless nights;<BR>
To watch the weeping rain, until I too<BR>
Would mix my tears with hers.  To see the hills<BR>
Bow their nude forms beneath the lashing hail,<BR>
To hear the strong trees groan.<BR>

Queen Mab!  Queen Mab!<BR>

A windflower leapt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hedge to-day.<BR>
One of thy dimples<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lent its mirth<BR>
To lessen the gloom<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the snow-tired earth.<BR>
A white-faced flower's<BR>

Maybe a windflower shows her shy white face,<BR>

Hiding their eyes (false messengers of Spring),<BR>
Justly ashamed of their own perfidy.<BR>
Therefore, sing softly.<BR>

QUEEN MAB <I>curls herself up among her emerald cushions, closes her

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
